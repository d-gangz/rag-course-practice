# Understanding Semaphores in Python AsyncIO

## What is a Semaphore?

A **semaphore** is a concurrency control mechanism that limits how many tasks can access a resource simultaneously.

Think of it like a **parking lot with limited spaces**:
- The parking lot has 5 spaces (capacity)
- When a car arrives and there's space, it parks
- When all 5 spaces are full, new cars must wait
- When a car leaves, a waiting car can park

## Why Do We Need Semaphores?

**Problem**: Making 1000 API calls at once can:
- Hit rate limits (e.g., OpenAI allows 500 requests/minute)
- Overwhelm servers
- Cause memory issues
- Result in errors and retries

**Solution**: Use a semaphore to limit concurrent operations to a safe number (e.g., 10 at a time).

---

## üéØ Critical Concept: What Semaphores Actually Control

**IMPORTANT**: This is the most common misunderstanding about semaphores.

### ‚ùå Common Misconception
"If I have `Semaphore(3)` and create 6 workers, only 3 workers run at a time."

### ‚úÖ Reality
**All 6 workers run simultaneously!** The semaphore only controls access to **specific code sections** inside the workers.

### How It Actually Works

```python
async def worker(name: str, sem: Semaphore):
    # ========== ZONE 1: UNRESTRICTED ==========
    # ALL 6 workers execute this section simultaneously
    print(f"{name}: Preparing...")
    prepare_data()

    # ========== ZONE 2: SEMAPHORE GATE ==========
    async with sem:  # ‚Üê Only 3 workers can be HERE at once
        # The expensive/protected section
        print(f"{name}: Inside gate, doing expensive work")
        await expensive_api_call()

    # ========== ZONE 3: UNRESTRICTED ==========
    # ALL 6 workers execute this section simultaneously
    print(f"{name}: Cleaning up...")
    cleanup()

async def main():
    sem = Semaphore(3)  # Gate capacity = 3

    # Coroutine loop - creates all 6 workers
    coros = [worker(f"W{i}", sem) for i in range(6)]

    # All 6 workers start immediately!
    await asyncio.gather(*coros)
```

### Visual Timeline

```
Time 0s: All 6 workers start and run Zone 1 simultaneously
         ‚Üì
         W0, W1, W2 enter the gate (async with sem:) - Gate full (3/3)
         W3, W4, W5 reach the gate but WAIT (gate is full)

Time 2s: W0, W1, W2 finish and exit the gate
         ‚Üì
         W3, W4, W5 now enter the gate (3/3)
         W0, W1, W2 continue to Zone 3 simultaneously

Time 4s: W3, W4, W5 finish and exit the gate
         ‚Üì
         All 6 workers continue to Zone 3 simultaneously
```

### Key Takeaways

1. **`async with sem:` is a GATE**, not a worker on/off switch
2. **All workers run simultaneously**, but queue at the gate
3. **Only N workers** (N = semaphore limit) can execute the code inside `async with sem:` at once
4. **Place the gate around expensive operations** (API calls, heavy I/O, resource-limited tasks)

### Real-World Analogy: Restaurant Kitchen

```python
async def delivery_driver(name: str, sem: Semaphore):
    # üöó Unrestricted: All 6 drivers drive to restaurant simultaneously
    await drive_to_restaurant()

    # üç≥ GATE: Only 3 orders can be cooked at once (kitchen capacity)
    async with sem:
        await kitchen_cook_order()  # Takes 10 minutes

    # üöó Unrestricted: All 6 drivers deliver simultaneously
    await deliver_to_customer()
```

All 6 drivers are working the whole time, but only 3 can have food cooked simultaneously because the kitchen capacity is limited.

---

## Example 1: Basic Semaphore (Beginner)

Let's see how the semaphore gate works with a clear demonstration.

```python
import asyncio
from asyncio import Semaphore

async def worker(name: str, sem: Semaphore):
    """A worker that needs to access a limited resource."""
    # ========== ALL 6 workers execute this line ==========
    print(f"{name}: Started! Approaching the gate...")

    # ========== GATE: Only 3 workers can pass at once ==========
    async with sem:  # Workers wait here if gate is full
        print(f"{name}: Inside the gate! Working on expensive task...")
        await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulate expensive work
        print(f"{name}: Finished expensive work, exiting gate.")

    # ========== ALL 6 workers execute this line ==========
    print(f"{name}: Past the gate, all done!")

async def main():
    sem = Semaphore(3)  # Gate capacity = 3 workers at once

    # Coroutine loop: Create 6 workers
    coros = [worker(f"Worker-{i}", sem) for i in range(6)]

    # All 6 workers start immediately!
    await asyncio.gather(*coros)

# Run it
asyncio.run(main())
```

**Output:**
```
Worker-0: Started! Approaching the gate...
Worker-1: Started! Approaching the gate...
Worker-2: Started! Approaching the gate...
Worker-3: Started! Approaching the gate...
Worker-4: Started! Approaching the gate...
Worker-5: Started! Approaching the gate...
# ‚Üë ALL 6 workers started simultaneously!

Worker-0: Inside the gate! Working on expensive task...
Worker-1: Inside the gate! Working on expensive task...
Worker-2: Inside the gate! Working on expensive task...
# ‚Üë First 3 workers pass through the gate (3/3 slots filled)
# Workers 3, 4, 5 are WAITING at the gate

# ... 2 seconds pass ...

Worker-0: Finished expensive work, exiting gate.
Worker-0: Past the gate, all done!
Worker-1: Finished expensive work, exiting gate.
Worker-1: Past the gate, all done!
Worker-2: Finished expensive work, exiting gate.
Worker-2: Past the gate, all done!

Worker-3: Inside the gate! Working on expensive task...
Worker-4: Inside the gate! Working on expensive task...
Worker-5: Inside the gate! Working on expensive task...
# ‚Üë Next 3 workers now pass through the gate

# ... 2 seconds pass ...

Worker-3: Finished expensive work, exiting gate.
Worker-3: Past the gate, all done!
Worker-4: Finished expensive work, exiting gate.
Worker-4: Past the gate, all done!
Worker-5: Finished expensive work, exiting gate.
Worker-5: Past the gate, all done!
```

**Key Points:**
- **All 6 workers start immediately** and run the code before `async with sem:`
- **`async with sem:` is the GATE** - only 3 workers can be inside at once
- Workers that reach a full gate **wait** at the `async with sem:` line
- When a worker exits the gate, a waiting worker can enter
- Automatic release when exiting `async with` block
- **The semaphore ONLY limits the code inside `async with sem:`**, not the entire worker function

---

## Example 2: API Calls with Semaphore (Intermediate)

Now let's simulate API calls with rate limiting.

```python
import asyncio
from asyncio import Semaphore
import time

async def call_api(request_id: int, sem: Semaphore):
    """Simulate an API call with rate limiting."""
    async with sem:  # Only N concurrent calls allowed
        print(f"[{time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')}] Request {request_id}: Starting API call")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate API response time
        print(f"[{time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')}] Request {request_id}: Completed")
        return f"Response for request {request_id}"

async def main():
    sem = Semaphore(5)  # Max 5 concurrent API calls

    # Create 20 API calls (coroutines)
    coros = [call_api(i, sem) for i in range(20)]

    # Run all (but only 5 will run at a time due to semaphore)
    start = time.time()
    results = await asyncio.gather(*coros)
    elapsed = time.time() - start

    print(f"\n‚úì Completed {len(results)} API calls in {elapsed:.2f} seconds")
    print(f"Average time per call: {elapsed/len(results):.2f}s")
    print(f"With semaphore=5, we run in batches: 20 calls / 5 concurrent = 4 batches √ó 1s = ~4s")

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Output:**
```
[14:30:00] Request 0: Starting API call
[14:30:00] Request 1: Starting API call
[14:30:00] Request 2: Starting API call
[14:30:00] Request 3: Starting API call
[14:30:00] Request 4: Starting API call
# ... 1 second passes ...
[14:30:01] Request 0: Completed
[14:30:01] Request 1: Completed
[14:30:01] Request 2: Completed
[14:30:01] Request 3: Completed
[14:30:01] Request 4: Completed
[14:30:01] Request 5: Starting API call  # Next batch starts
[14:30:01] Request 6: Starting API call
...
‚úì Completed 20 API calls in 4.01 seconds
```

**Key Insight:**
- Without semaphore: All 20 calls start at once ‚Üí potential rate limit errors
- With semaphore=5: Calls run in controlled batches of 5 ‚Üí safe and predictable

---

## Example 3: Real OpenAI API Calls (Advanced)

Let's use a real-world example with OpenAI API and error handling.

```python
import asyncio
from asyncio import Semaphore
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_fixed

client = AsyncOpenAI()

@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_fixed(2))
async def generate_completion(prompt: str, sem: Semaphore) -> str:
    """Generate completion with rate limiting and retry logic."""
    async with sem:  # Rate limiting
        print(f"üîµ Processing: '{prompt[:30]}...'")

        try:
            response = await client.chat.completions.create(
                model="gpt-4o-mini",
                messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
                max_tokens=50
            )
            result = response.choices[0].message.content
            print(f"‚úÖ Completed: '{prompt[:30]}...'")
            return result

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"‚ùå Error for '{prompt[:30]}...': {e}")
            raise  # Tenacity will retry

async def main():
    # Limit to 10 concurrent API calls (OpenAI rate limit)
    sem = Semaphore(10)

    # Create 50 prompts
    prompts = [f"Write a haiku about {topic}"
               for topic in ["ocean", "mountain", "forest", "desert", "city"] * 10]

    # Generate all completions (coroutines)
    coros = [generate_completion(prompt, sem) for prompt in prompts]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*coros, return_exceptions=True)

    # Count successes
    successes = [r for r in results if isinstance(r, str)]
    failures = [r for r in results if isinstance(r, Exception)]

    print(f"\nüìä Results:")
    print(f"   ‚úì Successful: {len(successes)}")
    print(f"   ‚úó Failed: {len(failures)}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Why This Works:**
1. **Semaphore(10)** = max 10 concurrent API calls (respects rate limits)
2. **@retry decorator** = automatic retry on failures
3. **async with sem** = acquires slot, waits if all 10 slots are full
4. **asyncio.gather** = runs all tasks efficiently

---

## Example 4: Comparing With vs Without Semaphore (Eye-Opening)

Let's see the difference in behavior.

```python
import asyncio
import time
from asyncio import Semaphore

async def api_call(request_id: int, sem: Semaphore = None):
    """Simulate an API call that might fail if too many run at once."""
    if sem:
        async with sem:
            return await _do_api_call(request_id)
    else:
        return await _do_api_call(request_id)

async def _do_api_call(request_id: int):
    """Simulate API that fails if >10 concurrent requests."""
    # Count how many tasks are running right now
    current_tasks = len([t for t in asyncio.all_tasks() if not t.done()])

    if current_tasks > 10:
        raise Exception(f"Rate limit exceeded! ({current_tasks} concurrent)")

    await asyncio.sleep(0.5)  # Simulate API delay
    return f"Success: {request_id}"

async def test_without_semaphore():
    """Run 50 API calls without rate limiting."""
    print("\nüö´ WITHOUT SEMAPHORE:")
    coros = [api_call(i) for i in range(50)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*coros, return_exceptions=True)

    failures = [r for r in results if isinstance(r, Exception)]
    print(f"   Failed requests: {len(failures)}")

async def test_with_semaphore():
    """Run 50 API calls with rate limiting."""
    print("\n‚úÖ WITH SEMAPHORE(10):")
    sem = Semaphore(10)
    coros = [api_call(i, sem) for i in range(50)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*coros, return_exceptions=True)

    failures = [r for r in results if isinstance(r, Exception)]
    print(f"   Failed requests: {len(failures)}")

async def main():
    await test_without_semaphore()
    await test_with_semaphore()

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Output:**
```
üö´ WITHOUT SEMAPHORE:
   Failed requests: 35  # Most requests fail due to rate limiting!

‚úÖ WITH SEMAPHORE(10):
   Failed requests: 0   # All succeed because we stay under limit
```

---

## Example 5: Dynamic Semaphore Adjustment (Expert)

Sometimes you want to adjust the semaphore limit dynamically based on success/failure rates.

```python
import asyncio
from asyncio import Semaphore

class AdaptiveSemaphore:
    """Semaphore that adjusts based on success rate."""

    def __init__(self, initial_limit: int = 10):
        self.limit = initial_limit
        self.sem = Semaphore(initial_limit)
        self.successes = 0
        self.failures = 0

    async def __aenter__(self):
        await self.sem.acquire()
        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        self.sem.release()

        if exc_type is None:
            self.successes += 1
            # If doing well, increase concurrency
            if self.successes % 10 == 0 and self.limit < 50:
                self.limit += 5
                print(f"üìà Increasing limit to {self.limit}")
                self._adjust_semaphore()
        else:
            self.failures += 1
            # If failing, decrease concurrency
            if self.failures % 3 == 0 and self.limit > 5:
                self.limit -= 5
                print(f"üìâ Decreasing limit to {self.limit}")
                self._adjust_semaphore()

    def _adjust_semaphore(self):
        """Recreate semaphore with new limit."""
        self.sem = Semaphore(self.limit)

async def api_call_with_adaptive(request_id: int, sem: AdaptiveSemaphore):
    """API call with adaptive rate limiting."""
    async with sem:
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
        # Randomly fail 10% of the time
        if request_id % 10 == 0:
            raise Exception("Random failure")
        return f"Success: {request_id}"

async def main():
    sem = AdaptiveSemaphore(initial_limit=10)

    coros = [api_call_with_adaptive(i, sem) for i in range(100)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*coros, return_exceptions=True)

    print(f"\nüìä Final Stats:")
    print(f"   Successes: {sem.successes}")
    print(f"   Failures: {sem.failures}")
    print(f"   Final limit: {sem.limit}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Key Takeaways

### When to Use Semaphores

‚úÖ **Use semaphores when:**
- Making many API calls (rate limiting)
- Accessing limited resources (database connections, file handles)
- Controlling memory usage (limit concurrent heavy operations)
- Preventing server overload

‚ùå **Don't use semaphores when:**
- Tasks are CPU-bound (use ProcessPoolExecutor instead)
- You need strict ordering (use Queue instead)
- Resource is truly unlimited

### Semaphore vs Other Patterns

| **Pattern** | **Use Case** | **Example** |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Semaphore** | Limit concurrent access | Max 10 API calls at once |
| **Lock** | Only 1 task at a time | Writing to a shared file |
| **Queue** | Task ordering matters | Job processing pipeline |
| **ThreadPoolExecutor** | CPU-bound work | Image processing |

### Best Practices

1. **Choose the right limit:**
   - Too low ‚Üí slow (underutilized)
   - Too high ‚Üí rate limit errors
   - Start with API provider's limit √∑ 2

2. **Always use `async with`:**
   ```python
   # ‚úÖ Good - automatic release
   async with sem:
       await do_work()

   # ‚ùå Bad - manual release (easy to forget)
   await sem.acquire()
   await do_work()
   sem.release()
   ```

3. **Combine with retry logic:**
   ```python
   @retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3))
   async def api_call(sem):
       async with sem:
           return await client.call()
   ```

4. **Monitor and adjust:**
   - Log semaphore wait times
   - Track success/failure rates
   - Adjust limits based on performance

## Comparison: Semaphore vs ThreadPoolExecutor

```python
# ‚ùå ThreadPoolExecutor (for API calls)
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def api_call(i):
    return requests.get(f"https://api.example.com/{i}")

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
    results = list(executor.map(api_call, range(100)))

# Problems:
# - Each thread uses ~8MB memory
# - Limited to ~10-20 workers (memory overhead)
# - Slower context switching
# - Python GIL contention
```

```python
# ‚úÖ Async + Semaphore (for API calls)
import asyncio
from asyncio import Semaphore
import httpx

async def api_call(i, sem):
    async with sem:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            return await client.get(f"https://api.example.com/{i}")

async def main():
    sem = Semaphore(50)  # Can handle 50+ concurrent!
    coros = [api_call(i, sem) for i in range(100)]
    return await asyncio.gather(*coros)

# Benefits:
# - Each coroutine uses ~1KB memory
# - Can handle 100+ concurrent easily
# - Faster event loop switching
# - No GIL issues
```

---

## Real-World Example: Your RAG Course Code

From your `01_syn_ques_eg.py`:

```python
@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_fixed(10))
async def generate_questions(chunk: Chunk, sem: Semaphore) -> ChunkEval:
    async with sem:  # Rate limiting (max 10 concurrent)
        coro = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o-mini",
            messages=[...],
            response_model=Question,
        )
        resp = await asyncio.wait_for(coro, timeout=30)
        return ChunkEval(...)

async def main():
    sem = Semaphore(10)  # Max 10 concurrent OpenAI calls

    # Create 100 tasks
    coros = [generate_questions(chunk, sem) for chunk in dataset]

    # Run all efficiently (only 10 at a time)
    results = await tqdm_asyncio.gather(*coros)
```

**Why this is perfect:**
- OpenAI rate limit: ~500 requests/min
- Semaphore(10) = max 10 concurrent
- Stays well under rate limit
- Efficient memory usage
- Automatic retry on failures

---

## Practice Exercise

Try converting the ThreadPoolExecutor code from your homework to use async + semaphore!

**Challenge:** Take the `synthetic_queries.py` file and convert:
- `ThreadPoolExecutor` ‚Üí `asyncio + Semaphore`
- `completion()` ‚Üí `acompletion()`
- `time.sleep()` ‚Üí `await asyncio.sleep()`
- `as_completed()` ‚Üí `tqdm_asyncio.gather()`

You'll see significant performance improvements! üöÄ

## üìö Quick Reference: Semaphore Pattern

### The Standard Pattern

```python
# 1. Parent function with coroutine loop
async def main():
    sem = Semaphore(N)  # Define gate capacity

    # Coroutine loop - creates all workers
    coros = [worker(data, sem) for data in dataset]

    # Run all workers (choose one):
    results = await asyncio.gather(*coros)  # No progress bar
    # OR
    results = await tqdm_asyncio.gather(*coros)  # With progress bar ‚ú®

# 2. Worker function with semaphore gate
async def worker(data, sem: Semaphore):
    # Unrestricted code (all workers can execute)
    prepare_data(data)

    # GATE: Only N workers can be here at once
    async with sem:
        result = await expensive_operation(data)

    # Unrestricted code (all workers can execute)
    cleanup(result)
    return result
```

### Progress Bar with tqdm_asyncio

For long-running operations with many tasks, use `tqdm_asyncio.gather()` to see progress:

```python
import asyncio
from asyncio import Semaphore
from tqdm.asyncio import tqdm_asyncio  # Add this import

async def main():
    sem = Semaphore(10)
    coros = [generate_question(chunk, sem) for chunk in dataset]

    # Shows a nice progress bar as tasks complete!
    results = await tqdm_asyncio.gather(*coros)
    # Output: 100%|‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà| 100/100 [00:45<00:00, 2.21it/s]
```

**When to use:**
- ‚úÖ **Use `tqdm_asyncio.gather()`** when:
  - Running 50+ tasks
  - Operations take more than a few seconds
  - You want to see progress (development/debugging)
  - You want to estimate time remaining

- ‚úÖ **Use `asyncio.gather()`** when:
  - Running < 10 quick tasks
  - Production scripts (no human watching)
  - You don't need visual feedback

**Note:** They're functionally identical - `tqdm_asyncio.gather()` just adds a progress bar on top of `asyncio.gather()`.

**Example from your code:**
```python
# week-1/01_syn_ques_eg.py line 105
questions: list[ChunkEval] = await tqdm_asyncio.gather(*coros)
# Shows progress for generating 100+ questions
```

### Mental Model Checklist

‚úÖ **Remember:**
1. `async with sem:` is a **GATE** for specific code sections
2. **All workers run simultaneously** - they just queue at the gate
3. **Only N workers** can execute code inside `async with sem:` at once
4. Place the gate **around expensive operations** (API calls, heavy I/O)
5. Workers **wait** at `async with sem:` if the gate is full
6. When a worker exits the gate, a waiting worker enters

‚ùå **Don't think:**
- "Semaphore limits how many workers run" ‚Üê Wrong! All workers run.
- "Semaphore controls the entire function" ‚Üê Wrong! Only controls the `async with sem:` block.

### Coroutines ‚âà Promises (JavaScript/TypeScript)

| **Python** | **JavaScript/TypeScript** |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| `coro = async_func()` | `promise = asyncFunc()` |
| `await coro` | `await promise` |
| `asyncio.gather(*coros)` | `Promise.all(promises)` |
| `async with sem:` | No direct equivalent (unique to Python) |

---

## üéì Summary

Semaphores are essential for controlling concurrent access to limited resources in async Python:

- **Use case**: Rate limiting API calls, managing database connections, controlling resource usage
- **Key concept**: Semaphore is a gate for specific code sections, not a worker limiter
- **Best for**: I/O-bound operations (API calls, file I/O, network requests)
- **Not for**: CPU-bound operations (use `ProcessPoolExecutor` instead)

Master semaphores and you'll write efficient, rate-limit-friendly concurrent code! üöÄ
